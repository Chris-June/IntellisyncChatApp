TODO List:

Database Implementation Requirements:
----------------------------------
1. Set up proper backend infrastructure for Dashboard data:
   - Evaluate and choose appropriate database solution (SQL vs NoSQL)
   - Design schema for:
     * Student progress and performance data
     * Teacher class management and analytics
     * Parent view metrics and progress tracking
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Ensure data security and privacy compliance

2. Current static data that needs DB storage:
   - Dashboard:
     * User statistics and metrics
     * Performance charts data
   - StudentView:
     * Learning progress
     * Subject strengths
     * Time spent analytics
   - TeacherView:
     * Class size and attendance
     * Student performance data
     * Completion rates
   - ParentView:
     * Child's progress across subjects
     * Performance metrics
     * Achievement tracking

3. Backend Tasks:
   - Create API endpoints for each dashboard view
   - Implement data caching for performance
   - Set up backup and recovery procedures
   - Create data migration strategy

Authentication and Routing Implementation:
----------------------------------------
1. Supabase Integration Steps:
   - Install Supabase client
   - Configure environment variables for Supabase connection
   - Set up authentication methods in supabaseAuth.js
   - Implement real-time session handling

2. Component Setup:
   - Wrap application with AuthProvider from contexts/AuthContext.jsx
   - Implement AppRoutes as main router
   - Set up protected route components for each user type
   - Add loading and error states to auth forms

3. Role-Based Access Implementation:
   - Configure user roles in Supabase
   - Set up role-permission mappings
   - Implement permission checks in protected routes
   - Add role-specific redirects

4. Protected Routes Structure:
   Student Routes (/student/*):
   - Dashboard
   - Progress
   - Assignments
   - Grades

   Parent Routes (/parent/*):
   - Dashboard
   - Children List
   - Progress Tracking
   - Communications

   Teacher Routes (/teacher/*):
   - Dashboard
   - Class Management
   - Assignment Management
   - Grading
   - Student Management

   Admin Routes (/admin/*):
   - Dashboard
   - User Management
   - Settings
   - Analytics

5. Security Considerations:
   - Implement proper session management
   - Set up secure authentication flows
   - Add rate limiting
   - Configure security headers
   - Implement data encryption where necessary

6. Testing Requirements:
   - Test authentication flows
   - Verify role-based access
   - Test protected routes
   - Validate permission checks
   - Test error handling

Note: Keep existing mock data for demo purposes while implementing authentication.
